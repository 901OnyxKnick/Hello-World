<h1> 3...2...1 TAKEOFF :collision: </h1>
<p>My name is Knicklaus Thomas, and I am originally from [Memphis, TN](https://www.memphistravel.com/)! I am huge Florida Gators fan due to my dad being a die heart fan when I was a kid. I am majoring in Information Technology, and a student at the University of Missouri. <i>Aviation</i> is a big part of my life, and the sky is home for me. This is a small synopsis of who I am, and I will continue to take you all through parts of my life and some projects I created this year. </p>
