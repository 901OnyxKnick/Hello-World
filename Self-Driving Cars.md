<h2> SKY IS HOME! </h2>
<p> Whether you are flying private in a 50 million dollar jet or roaring through the clouds with the United States Military, planes are number on my list. The sky is home for me, and the many other people who love everything about aircraft. I was close to majoring in Mechanical Engineering, but I found out quickly that I could care less about the mechanical or engineering of a plane as long as I am the pilot. Aviation became a huge part of my life as I grew up in Memphis, TN near one of the biggest Aviation giants in the world.
