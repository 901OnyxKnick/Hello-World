<h2> I DONT NEED HUMANS, I CAN DRIVE MYSELF </h2>
<p> Technology is slowly, but surely becoming key to the world we live in today. Due to technology, COVID-19 was survivable, and Americans did what they had to do mitigate the spread through the use of technology. Technology is booming at an all time high, and it is here to stay for the duration of my time as a human.</p>

## Self driven cars such as :
<ul>
  <li> [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) </li>
  <li> [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) </li>
  <li> [Volvo](https://group.volvocars.com/company/innovation/autonomous-drive) </li>
</ul>
<p1> are all apart of the next generation of autonomous vehicles. As the world continue to evolve, technology will become key in our life. Auto-pilot have been a feature used on aircrafts for many generations, and they are now developing that for cars. Self-driven cars is a key reason in why I chose Information Technology as my major. It was the last big push I needed. Technology will soon become the center of America. </p1>
